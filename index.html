		</h3>
		
			<p class = "paragraphs">
				Giannis Antetokounmpo was born in Athens, Greece, on December 6, 1994, as  
				the son of immigrants from Nigeria, Charles and Veronica Antetokounmpo.
				Three years earlier, his parents had moved from Lagos, leaving behind their firstborn son, 
				Francis, with his grandparents. Though Giannis and three of 
				his four brothers were born in Greece, they did not automatically 
				receive full Greek citizenship. For the first 18 years of his life, Giannis 
				was effectively stateless, having no papers from Nigeria or Greece.
			</p>
			
			<p class = "paragraphs">
				Antetokounmpo grew up in the Athens neighborhood of Sepolia.
				His parents, as immigrants, could not easily find work, 
				so Antetokounmpo and his older brother, Thanasis, 
				helped by hawking watches, handbags and sunglasses in the streets. 
				In 2007, Antetokounmpo started playing basketball, and by 2009, 
				he was playing competitively for the youth squad of Filathlitikos.
